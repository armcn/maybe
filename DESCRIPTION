Title: The Maybe Monad
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Andrew",
           family = "McNeil",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "andrew.richard.mcneil@gmail.com")
Description: 
    The maybe type represents the possibility of some value or nothing. 
    It is often used instead of throwing an error or returning `NULL`.
    The advantage of using a maybe type over `NULL` is that it is both composable 
    and requires the developer to explicitly acknowledge the potential absence 
    of a value, helping to avoid the existence of unexpected behaviour.
