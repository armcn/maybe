Title: The Maybe Monad

Description: 
    The maybe type represents the possibility of some value or nothing. 
    It is often used instead of throwing an error or returning `NULL`.
    The advantage of using a maybe type over `NULL` is that it is both composable 
    and requires the developer to explicitly acknowledge the potential absence 
    of a value, helping to avoid the existence of unexpected behaviour.
