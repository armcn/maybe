This is a resubmission.

The automated CRAN checks found invalid URLs. I have changed them to the 
recommended format.

## Test Environments

- local R installation, R 4.1.0
- Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC
- Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran
- Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

2 notes on Windows, 0 on Linux or macOS

Notes:

1. Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
   Monad (2:18)
   composable (12:72)

These are both correctly spelled words

2. Found the following files/directories:
   'lastMiKTeXException'
      
This note happens on my previously accepted CRAN package. 
Seems to be no way to resolve the note.
