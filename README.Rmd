# Overview

The maybe type represents the possibility of some value or nothing. It is often 
used instead of throwing an error or returning an undefined value like `NA` or 
`NULL`. The advantage of using a maybe type is that the functions which work with
it are both composable and require the developer to explicitly acknowledge the 
potential absence of a value, helping to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Installation

You can install the released version of maybe from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("maybe")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("armcn/maybe")
```

# Usage

Maybe values can be used to model computations that may fail or have undefined 
outputs. For example, dividing by zero is mathematically undefined but in many 
programming languages, including R, infinity is returned. If it is not properly
accounted for this may cause unexpected behavior later in the program. The maybe
type can be used to improve the safety of the divide function.

```{r}
library(maybe)

`%//%` <- function(a, b) {
  if (b == 0) nothing() else just(a / b)
}

10 / 2
10 %//% 2

10 / 0
10 %//% 0
```

`10 %//% 2` returns `Just 5` and `10 %//% 0` 
returns `Nothing`. These are the two possible values of the maybe type. It can 
be `Just` the value, or it can be `Nothing`, the absence of a value. For the 
value to be used as an input to another function you need to specify what will 
happen if the function returns `Nothing`. This can be done using the 
`with_default` function. This function will return the value contained in the 
`Just`, or if it is `Nothing` it will return the default. Think of a maybe value 
as a container. In this container can be `Just` the value or `Nothing`. To use 
the contained value in a regular R function you need to unwrap it first.

```{r}
10 %//% 2
10 %//% 2 |> with_default(0)

10 %//% 0
10 %//% 0 |> with_default(0)
```

This may seem tedious to rewrite functions to return maybe values and then 
specify a default value each time. This is where the maybe chaining functions
become useful. `map_maybe` allows a regular R function to be evaluated on a maybe
value. `map_maybe`, often called `fmap` in other languages, reaches into the 
maybe value, applies a function to the value, then re-wraps the result in a 
maybe. If the input is a `Just` value, the return value of `map_maybe` will also 
be a `Just`. If it is `Nothing` the return value will be `Nothing`.

```{r}
safe_max <- function(a) {
  if (length(a) == 0L) nothing() else just(max(a))
}

just(9) |> map_maybe(sqrt)
nothing() |> map_maybe(sqrt)

safe_max(1:9) |> map_maybe(sqrt)
safe_max(integer()) |> map_maybe(sqrt)
```

What if we wanted to chain multiple "safe" functions (functions that return 
maybe values) together? The function `and_then`, often called `bind` in other 
languages, works similarly to `map_maybe` except the function provided must 
return a maybe value.

```{r}
safe_sqrt <- function(a) {
  if (a < 0) nothing() else just(sqrt(a))
}

just(9) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
nothing() |> and_then(safe_sqrt)

safe_max(1:9) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
safe_max(integer()) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
```

The maybe package provides another way to create functions that return maybe
values. Instead of rewriting the function to return maybe values we can wrap it 
in the `maybe` function. This will modify the function to return `Nothing` on 
an error or warning. A predicate function (a function that returns `TRUE` or
`FALSE`) can be provided as an argument to assert something about the return 
value. If the predicate returns `TRUE` then a `Just` value will be returned,
otherwise it will be `Nothing`.

```{r}
safe_max <- maybe(max)
safe_sqrt <- maybe(sqrt, ensure = not_infinite)

safe_max(1:9) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
safe_max("hello") |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
```

This pattern of modifying a function with the `maybe` function and then setting 
a default value is so common that there is a shortcut, `perhaps`. The default 
value is set with the `default` parameter. This function will always return a 
regular R value, never maybe values.

```{r}
safe_max <- perhaps(max, ensure = is.numeric, default = 0)

safe_max(1:9) |> sqrt()
safe_max("hello") |> sqrt()
```

Multiple predicates can be combined with the `and`/`or` functions.

```{r}
safe_sqrt <- maybe(mean, ensure = and(not_infinite, not_empty))

safe_sqrt(9)
```

Predefined combinations are also provided such as `not_undefined`, which ensures 
that the output is not any of `NULL`, `NA`, `NaN`, `-Inf`, or `Inf`.

```{r}
safe_mean <- maybe(mean, ensure = not_undefined)

safe_mean(c(1, 2, 3))
safe_mean(c(NA, 2, 3))
```

## Function names

The names of functions `map_maybe`, `and_then`, `flatten_maybe`, and 
`with_default` are different from the traditional names used for these functions 
in other functional programming languages. If you would like to use the more
traditional names aliases are provided.

- `fmap` == `map_maybe`
- `bind` == `and_then`
- `join` == `flatten_maybe`
- `from_maybe` == `with_default`
