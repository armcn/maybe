# Overview

The maybe type represents the possibility of some value or nothing. 
It is often used instead of throwing an error or returning `NULL`.
The advantage of using a maybe type over `NULL` is that it is both composable 
and requires the developer to explicitly acknowledge the potential absence 
of a value, helping to avoid the existence of unexpected behavior.

## Installation

You can install the released version of maybe from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("maybe")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("armcn/maybe")
```

# Usage

Maybe values can be used to model computations that may fail or have
undefined outputs. For example, dividing by zero is mathematically
undefined but many programming languages, including R, return infinity.
This can cause unexpected problems later on in the program. We can use a
maybe value to make a safe divide function.

```{r}
library(maybe)

safe_divide <- function(a, b) {
  if (b == 0) nothing() else just(a / b)
}

2 / 2
safe_divide(2, 2)

2 / 0
safe_divide(2, 0)
```

This time `2 / 2` returns `Just 1` and `2 / 0` returns `Nothing`. These
are the two possibly values of a maybe value. It can be `Just` the
value, or it can be `Nothing` (the absence of a value). For the maybe value to 
be used by another function, first you need to specify what will happen if the 
function returns `Nothing`. This can be done using the `with_default` function. 
This function will return the value contained in the `Just`, or if it is 
`Nothing` it will return the default. Think of a maybe value as a container.
In this container can be `Just` the value or `Nothing`. To use the contained
value in regular R functions you need to unwrap it first.

```{r}
safe_divide(2, 2)
safe_divide(2, 2) |> with_default(0)

safe_divide(2, 0)
safe_divide(2, 0) |> with_default(0)
```

It gets more interesting when we chain maybe values together. Instead of
having to use `with_default` every time you use a function that produces
maybe values, they can be chained and `with_default` only needs to be
called once at the end.

As an example, we may want to divide two numbers then get the absolute value of
the result. This is accomplished with the `map_maybe` function. `map_maybe`,
often called `fmap` in other languages, reaches into the maybe value, applies
a function to the value, then re-wraps the result in a maybe. If the input is
a `Just` value, the return value of `map_maybe` will also be a `Just`. If it is
`Nothing` the return value will be `Nothing`.

```{r}
safe_divide(-2, 2)
safe_divide(-2, 2) |> map_maybe(abs)

safe_divide(-2, 0)
safe_divide(-2, 0) |> map_maybe(abs)
```

What if we wanted to chain multiple "safe" functions (functions that
return maybe values) together? For that we use `and_then`. This function is 
often called `bind` in other languages. First let's define two "safe" functions 
then call them one after the other.

```{r}
safe_mean <- function(a) {
  if (length(a) == 0L) nothing() else just(mean(a))
}

safe_sqrt <- function(a) {
  if (a == -1) nothing() else just(sqrt(a))
}

safe_mean(1:10) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
```

Functions can also be converted to "safe" functions in another way.
Instead of rewriting the function we can wrap it in the function `maybe`. This 
will modify the function to return `Nothing` on error or warning and we can
optionally provide a predicate function (a function that returns `TRUE` or
`FALSE`) to assert something about the result. For example here are the above 
functions made "safe" with the `maybe` function.

```{r}
safe_mean <- maybe(mean, ensure = not_nan)
safe_sqrt <- maybe(sqrt, ensure = not_infinite)

safe_mean("hello") |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
safe_mean(1:10) |> and_then(safe_sqrt)
```

It will automatically capture errors and warnings and return `Nothing`.
Warnings can be allowed by setting `allow_warnings = TRUE`.

```{r}
safe_mean <- maybe(mean)

safe_mean(1:10)
safe_mean("hello")

safe_mean <- maybe(mean, allow_warning = TRUE)

safe_mean("hello")
```

The pattern of wrapping a function in the `maybe` function and then setting a 
default value is so common there is a shortcut, `perhaps`. The default value is 
set with the `default` parameter. This function will always return regular R 
values, not maybes.

```{r}
safe_mean <- perhaps(mean, default = 0)

safe_mean(1:10)
safe_mean("hello")
```

We can combine multiple predicates with the `and`/`or` functions.

```{r}
safe_mean <- maybe(mean, ensure = and(not_nan, not_empty))

safe_mean(1:10)
```

Or use predefined combinations like `not_undefined` which checks if the
output is not any of `NULL`, `NA`, `NaN`, `-Inf`, or `Inf`.

```{r}
safe_mean <- maybe(mean, ensure = not_undefined)

safe_mean(c(1, 2, 3))
safe_mean(c(NA, 2, 3))
```

The names of `map_maybe`, `and_then`, `flatten_maybe`, and `with_default` are 
different than the traditional function names in other FP languages. 
I believe these names more clearly articulate the purpose of these functions
but aliases are provided. In a single project please choose to use one set or 
the other, not both.

- `fmap` == `map_maybe`
- `join` == `flatten_maybe`
- `bind` == `and_then`
- `from_maybe` == `with_default`
